            <h3>Health Management</h3>

            <p>
              Good health is the cornerstone of a productive flock. Chickens are
              prone to a variety of diseases, such as Marekâ€™s disease,
              coccidiosis, and respiratory infections. Regular health checks are
              crucial, and you should keep an eye out for symptoms like
              lethargy, loss of appetite, or abnormal droppings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vaccinations are also essential in preventing common chicken
              diseases. Consult your veterinarian to establish a vaccination
              schedule that works for your flock. Additionally, ensure that your
              chickens are kept in clean conditions to minimize the risk of
              parasites and diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, maintaining a healthy environment through good
              biosecurity practices, like limiting access to your chickens by
              outside animals, helps reduce disease spread.

            <h3>Feeding & Nutrition</h3>

            <p>
              Feeding your chickens the right food is essential for their health
              and productivity. Chickens need a balanced diet consisting of
              protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. You should provide
              them with high-quality chicken feed that is appropriate for their
              age and purpose (layers, broilers, or dual-purpose chickens).
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to their regular feed, chickens can benefit from
              treats like fresh vegetables, fruits, and grains. However, avoid
              feeding them harmful foods like avocado, chocolate, or raw
              potatoes, as these can be toxic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Provide clean, fresh water at all times to ensure your chickens
              stay hydrated. Proper hydration is essential for egg production
              and overall health.

            <h3>Housing & Environment</h3>

            <p>
              A clean, safe, and comfortable living environment is essential for
              your chickens. The chicken coop should be well-ventilated, dry,
              and free from drafts. Make sure to provide enough space for each
              chicken to move around comfortably, as overcrowding can lead to
              stress and health issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Install secure fencing around the coop to protect your chickens
              from predators, such as raccoons, foxes, and hawks. The coop
              should also have access to natural light and be kept at a
              comfortable temperature. In colder climates, you may need to
              insulate the coop to keep your chickens warm during winter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't forget to add bedding, such as straw or wood shavings, to
              help absorb moisture and prevent the buildup of harmful bacteria.
              Regularly clean the coop and replace the bedding to maintain a
              hygienic environment.
