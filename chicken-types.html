            <h3>Leghorn</h3>
            <p>
              The Leghorn is one of the most popular chicken breeds,
              particularly prized for its egg-laying ability and hardiness.
              Known for its high productivity and adaptability, the Leghorn is
              often the breed of choice in commercial egg production.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leghorns are exceptional egg layers, producing 300+ eggs per year,
              often with white eggs. They are consistent throughout the year,
              making them ideal for large-scale egg production.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leghorns are medium-sized chickens, typically white with a slim,
              athletic build. They are not known for being particularly docile
              but are very efficient foragers and independent.

            <h3>Rhode Island Red</h3>
            <p>
              The Rhode Island Red is a popular chicken breed known for its
              dual-purpose qualities, excelling as both an egg layer and a meat
              chicken. Originating in the United States in the mid-1800s, this
              hardy breed is perfect for backyard farmers and small-scale
              homesteads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rhode Island Reds are consistent egg layers, producing about
              250-300 eggs per year. They lay brown eggs and continue to produce
              in colder months.
            </p>
            <p>
              With deep red feathers, they are medium to large-sized chickens.
              Roosters weigh about 8-9 lbs, and hens are around 6-7 lbs.

            <h3>Plymouth Rock</h3>

            <p>
              The Plymouth Rock is a popular chicken breed known for its
              attractive striped plumage and gentle temperament. Ideal for
              backyard flocks, this breed is both friendly and active, making it
              a great choice for families and new poultry keepers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plymouth Rocks are reliable egg layers, producing 200-280 eggs per
              year. They typically lay brown eggs and are consistent throughout
              the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              They have a distinctive striped pattern (alternating dark and
              light feathers) and a medium build. The stripes give them a unique
              and attractive look.
